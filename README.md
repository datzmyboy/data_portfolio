#👋 Hi, I'm Dat!

I’m building my **data analytics portfolio** to showcase my learning journey.  
I started getting interested in data when I was assigned to HR, where I helped monitor PPE and employee access passes.  
Although it wasn’t a direct data role, analyzing those reports allowed me to draw intuitive insights — and that’s when I realized how much I enjoyed working with data.  

Since I’m already comfortable with **Python**, I decided to leverage it and dive deeper into **data analytics**.

### 🧰 Tools
**Python** | **SQL**

## 🍕 [Pizza Sales Data Analytics Project](https://github.com/datzmyboy/data_project1)
This is my **first full data analytics project** after completing a SQL course on DataCamp.  
I used **SQL** to extract and calculate KPIs from a pizza sales dataset, and **Python (Matplotlib)** for visualizations.  
While working on this, I also learned how to use Matplotlib — which turned out to be an awesome tool for visual storytelling!
